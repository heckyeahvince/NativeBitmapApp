##TODO: Migrate this project to Experimental Gradle plugin (Please refer to previous assignments for sample build.)

## Warning

 Note the Gradle plugin is at the experimental stage. The Gradle API for the new component model is not final, which means it'll only work with a specific version of Gradle until the APIs are final.

For issues, refer to:

(http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental)

## Pre-requisites
--------------
- Android Studio 1.3+ with [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/) bundle.
